      <h3>I see things that should'nt exist </h3>
      <p>The first story is something I don’t fully remember, because I was only about 4 or 5 years old. I was living in Poland, and I clearly recall seeing a dark, tall figure once. It was about 180–190 cm tall, wearing jeans and a leather jacket. It had no face, but you could make out a round, shaved-looking head. 
From what my parents told me, at that time we were sleeping in what is now the common room of our house on the second floor. One night, I suddenly said: “Look, Mom! Someone is looking through the window!” My brother said the same thing, but my mom claimed she didn’t see anything. 
According to her, both me and my brother described seeing that figure countless times. We were so scared that we stopped sleeping in the common room and stayed in our parents’ bedroom instead. Later, my mom and dad visited a woman in Gdynia, who told them that someone might have placed a curse on me and my brother. She gave them instructions to remove it (I never found out what exactly they did), but after they followed her advice, the figure stopped appearing. Personally, I only distinctly remember seeing it once. 
The second story happened about 3 or 4 years ago, just a day or two after my grandma passed away. She lived next door, and from my house I could see the window to her room. One evening, around 8 or 9 pm, I glanced toward her window and saw a figure that looked eerily similar to my grandma. It vanished behind a wall, and that was the last time I ever saw it. 
My relatives who lived in the same house said they sometimes heard footsteps at night coming from her room. Once, my cousin had to sleep in her bed, and she said the mattress felt warm — as if someone had been lying next to her. 
On the day my grandma died, my brother also experienced sleep paralysis. He described it like this: he was lying in bed when he saw her standing in the corner of our room, smiling in an uncanny, unsettling way. Slowly, she began creeping toward his bed. He tried to move, but couldn’t. When she reached the foot of his bed, her head began spinning around 360 degrees, spinning faster and faster as she came closer, while still keeping the same terrifying grin. 
When she finally reached his chest, she climbed on top of him and stood there for about 10–15 seconds. During that time, he couldn’t breathe. Then suddenly, he woke up. What’s chilling is that he woke up just moments before my mom got the call that my grandma had passed away — around midnight. 
So yeah… those are my horror stories.</p>

      <h3>Fire that got caused by NOTHING </h3>
      <p>Ok so I wake up in the middle of the night to a intense heat in my room, I look at my clock and it’s 3 in the morning, I open my cortens to look outside to see raging fire spreading all over my house. I try to open my door but the handles to hot, I scream and my dad comes and kicks the door down to get me out, we crawl out the house in panic. As soon as we got outside a spark flys to me but slightly misses. We all get into our car right next to the house trying to get away. The car won’t start, my dad tries again and we drive out of the drive way to watch from a far helplessly. It was apparently “to cold” to use the fire hydrant for water so we had to sit there for hours watching our house cooked. We lost 6 cats that day, my dog and 3 other cats survived.</p>

      <h3>Chapel Story</h3>
      <p>Once in a forgotten chapel, I saw symbols etched into stone glowing faintly at night. No priest ever spoke of them, but the villagers never went near the place after dark.</p>
